This project titled **"Lexical Analyzer in C"** was completed as part of the CODTECH internship to understand the basics of compiler design. The program was written and tested using the **Programiz Online C Compiler**, a simple and accessible platform ideal for running C code without installing any software. In this task, instead of reading from an external file, the source code was directly stored in a string within the program to ensure compatibility with online compilers. The lexical analyzer scans this code and identifies different tokens such as **keywords** (e.g., `int`, `float`), **identifiers** (e.g., `x`, `main`), **numbers**, and **operators** (e.g., `=`, `+`). This task helped in understanding the first phase of a compiler — lexical analysis — and how source code is broken down into meaningful parts for further processing. Such concepts are crucial for future work in compiler construction, interpreters, syntax highlighters, and tools like code editors or debuggers, where analyzing and understanding code structure is essential.
